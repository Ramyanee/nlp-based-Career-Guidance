# nlp-based-Career-Guidance
This is an nlp interfaced career guidance that takes inputs from user regarding their interests and choices, parses and stores them as facts, and suggests career options by running a prolog backend 


first run nlp.py to take user unputs

then run ca.pl to run prolog backen

possible upgradation: prolog file can be connected directly to the python file to get output in the python file itself.
